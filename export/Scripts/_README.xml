' SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
' ==================
'
' 1. Set some good defaults in the Cfg UDAs
'	- AlarmMessage: as you can see in INIT, this UDA can include two variables &lt;HOST&gt; and &lt;PINGS&gt;
'	- MaxFailedPings: number of pings to miss before setting the alarms
'	- Hosts: set the hosts (either using IP or host name) that you'd like to monitor
'	- HostsEnabled: turn ON for each host that coorresponds to the Hosts array that you'd like to ping
'	- PingFrequency: set to any value higher than 00:00:01.0000000 for the frequency at which you'd like to initiate pings
'	- Timeout: the timeout in milliseconds that the system ping will use for trying to reach the node. Default set to 10 seconds (10000 ms).
'
' 2. Deploy to engine
'
' 3. If you'd liked to use the included graphic, pop it into InTouch. Hopefully will have some improvements to this in the future.
